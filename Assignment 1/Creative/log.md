- <del>I've got some idea on how to change color of text while changing theme, in module sv_ttk(the theme module that i am using to make it looks better from github) there is a function "sv_ttk.get_theme()" which can return the current color theme. That sounds great but I don't know how to refresh the color of text after "sv_ttk.get_theme()" return a new color. So I decide to start with dark theme first, I will probably improve this later</del>
- nvm I was thinking too complex, its easy to change color of text while changing theme and I have used it in the button already 
**29/09/2023 later same day** 
- Changed the whole theme to "Sun-Valley-ttk-theme"
